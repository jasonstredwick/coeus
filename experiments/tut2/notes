Thinking of this as an alternative window manager.  To that end, do I only need to control the entire screen?
I think at this point it is most productive to enter full screen mode where the OS/window managers give more
control over the system rather than use through a compositor.  While this requires many working components, I
would like to reduce the visibility of each component from the other.  Maybe I can use concepts and/or abstract
base class interfaces to achieve this?

Decided: Use Vulkan as primary rendering layer
Undecided: GLFW or custom thin layer over OS window managers.  If the latter then only the minimum support from
an OS is required; for example only XCB/XLIB instead of Wayland.
I would like to seperate the windowing/display from the input and system services.
